#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems. It involves the design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance of software products.
Importance in the technology industry include the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life, including communication, commerce, entertainment, and healthcare.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1.	The establishment of software engineering as a discipline (1950s), this facilitated easier coding and debugging.
2.	The advent of Structured Programming (1970s), this improved code readability and maintainability.
3.	The rise of Agile Methodologies (2000s), enhanced flexibility and responsiveness to changing requirements.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements: Gathering, understanding and documenting user needs and system requirements.
Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure and verify that the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers.
Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall: It is a sequential approach with distinct phases (e.g., requirements, design, implementation) flowing downwards like a waterfall. For example, infrastructure projects, whereas,
Agile: An iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change. For example, the creation of software startups.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
The Software Developer is responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
The Quality Assurance Engineer ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
The Project Manager oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs): Software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code. For example, Visual Studio, Eclipse and IntelliJ IDEA.
Version Control Systems (VCS): Software tools for tracking changes and ensure collaborative work to source code and coordinating work among team members preventing code conflicts and loss. For example, Git and Subversion.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing Requirements: Requirements may change during the development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays.
Tight Deadlines: Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality.
Technical Debt: Accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, technical debt can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing: It ensures testing individual components or modules of software.
Integration Testing: It tests the interactions between different components or subsystems.
System Testing: It testing the entire software system as a whole.
Acceptance Testing: It testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is all about crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models. 
Importance of prompt engineering in interacting with AI models helps in guiding AI responses in order to make questions clear and specific, so the AI understands exactly what you need.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt: Tell me about cars.
Improved Prompt: Explain the advantages of electric cars over traditional gasoline-powered vehicles in terms of environmental impact, cost-efficiency, and maintenance.
Why itâ€™s more effective: The improved prompt is specific, providing clear direction and context, which leads to a more focused and relevant AI response.
